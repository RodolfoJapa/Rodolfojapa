## 📓 Notebook Structure

The project is implemented in **one single Jupyter Notebook**, organized as follows:

1. Imports and configuration  
2. Synthetic data generation  
3. Data quality checks  
4. Data cleaning (missing value handling)  
5. Feature engineering  
6. Statistical analysis  
7. Data visualization  
8. Performance benchmarking  
9. Final pipeline summary  

This structure mirrors **real-world production pipelines** while remaining simple and readable.
