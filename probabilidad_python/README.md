# 📊 Law of Large Numbers (LLN)

Production-style **Data Science project** demonstrating the **Law of Large Numbers** using numerical simulation in **Python**, executed in **Google Colab**.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project shows how the **sample mean converges to the expected value** as the number of observations increases, validating a fundamental concept in probability and statistics widely used in data science and machine learning.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- Python 3  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Google Colab  

---

## 🧪 Method

1. Generate random samples from a known distribution  
2. Compute the running (cumulative) mean  
3. Compare it with the theoretical expected value  
4. Visualize convergence behavior  

---

## 📈 Outcome

As the sample size grows, the sample mean stabilizes and converges to the expected value, confirming the **Law of Large Numbers**.

## 📁 Structure

---

## ▶️ Run

Open the notebook in **Google Colab** and run all cells.
