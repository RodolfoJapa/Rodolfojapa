# 📊 Data Science Project – Pandas in Production (Google Colab)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project was created to demonstrate **practical and production-ready usage of Pandas** as part of a **Data Science professional portfolio**.

The notebook simulates a **real-world data pipeline**, executed entirely in **Google Colab**, covering:
- Data ingestion
- Data validation
- Data cleaning
- Feature engineering
- Aggregation & analytics
- Visualization
- Export of production-ready outputs

All data used in this project is **synthetically generated** to replicate transactional data commonly found in production systems.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**
- **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**
- **Google Colab**

## 🗂️ Project Structure

---

## 🔄 Data Pipeline Workflow
1. **Data Generation** – Synthetic transactional data
2. **Data Validation** – Quality and consistency checks
3. **Data Cleaning** – Standardization and formatting
4. **Feature Engineering** – Business logic features
5. **Aggregation** – KPIs and grouped analytics
6. **Visualization** – Business insights with charts
7. **Export** – Production-ready files

---

## 📈 Visualizations Included
- Total sales by category
- Monthly revenue trend
- Transaction amount distribution
- High-value transaction ratio
- KPI summary table

These visualizations reflect **real analytics dashboards** used in production environments.

---

## 📦 Outputs
- **monthly_sales.parquet** – Aggregated sales data
- **sample_transactions.csv** – Sample dataset for audits or analysis
- **KPI metrics** displayed in the notebook

---

## 🚀 How to Run
1. Open **Google Colab**
2. Upload the notebook
3. Run all cells sequentially
4. Generated files will appear in the Colab file system

---

## 🎯 Key Learnings Demonstrated
- Pandas used at **production scale**
- Modular and readable code
- Data validation best practices
- Business-oriented analytics
- Clean visual storytelling
- Portfolio-ready structure

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add logging and monitoring
